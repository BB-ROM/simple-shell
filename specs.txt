Things to follow:
curly braces - ex.

// description of the function
int funct() {
                    <- empty space
    //some code...
                    <- empty space
}

Keep functions short - one function - one responsibility

please watch what files are being added to git - make sure you only add things
you wrote - don't add anything from the Clion project filesystem or makefile(?)
